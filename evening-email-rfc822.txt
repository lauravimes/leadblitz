Subject: 📈 Evening Brief — Monday 16th Feb | New User + Critical Bug Found

Steven,

High energy update coming at you! 🚀

**🔥 BIG NEWS: User #8 Signed Up Today**
- Email: choudharykartik87@gmail.com 
- Name: Karthick Periyasamy, Team Lead Ops & Service Delivery at Prodeets, Chennai
- Background: 8+ years B2B lead generation experience
- Red flag: This isn't our target web designer — he's likely evaluating LeadBlitz as competition/research
- Status: Welcome email sent, monitoring his activity closely

**🚨 CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED**
Registration is giving users 50 credits instead of 200. Karthick got shorted. Need urgent fixes:
1. Fix the hardcoded value in register route (check main.py, helpers/credits.py)
2. Manual credit bump for Karthick (50 → 200)

**📊 ANALYTICS SURGE**
GA4 last 7 days: 30 active users (was 8), 29 new users, 407 events. Traffic breakdown:
- India: 18 users (mostly low-intent?)
- UK: 10 users  
- US: 2 users
- Still zero organic search traffic — SEO needs work

**🐦 REDDIT BUILDING MOMENTUM**
u/Steven-Leadblitz stats: 6 comment karma, 1 post karma, ~25 quality comments across 8 subreddits (r/SaaS, r/webdesign, r/freelance, etc.). Almost ready for first promotional posts — probably Tuesday/Wednesday.

**📧 OUTREACH MONITORING**
Still watching replies from those 43 agency emails sent Friday. Zero responses so far but it's early days. Will chase if needed.

**🛠️ WEEKEND PROGRESS**
- PDF reports: Replit agent started Saturday 11:40am — likely completed over weekend, need to verify
- Blog Article 4: "Follow-Up Sequence That Turns Silence Into Signed Contracts" (~1,900 words) — written and ready to deploy to leadblitz.co

**🎯 TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES**
1. Fix registration bug (CRITICAL)
2. Verify PDF reports completed
3. Deploy Blog Article 4
4. Continue Reddit karma building
5. Monitor outreach replies

Everything's moving fast. That registration bug is urgent but otherwise we're in great shape!

Full project status board updated: projects/status.md (2026-02-16 18:00 GMT)

## Key Tasks Added:
L27: FIX REGISTRATION BUG (50 credits vs 200) — CRITICAL
L28: Manual credit bump for User #8 (Karthick) — 50 → 200 credits

## Updated Metrics:
- Users: 8 (new: Karthick Chennai)
- GA4 weekly users: 30 (29 new, 407 events, mostly India/UK)
- Reddit karma: 6 comment, 1 post (~25 total comments)

Let's crush tomorrow! 🚀
