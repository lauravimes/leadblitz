## Token Crisis Resolution (FINAL)
- **Problem:** Workspace hit 193k/200k tokens, nearly causing communication blackout
- **Root cause:** Binary image files in leadblitz-code/ were being counted as "words" 
- **Solution:** 
  - Emergency cleanup archived old files (briefing templates, old JSON data)
  - Final text content: 213k words (safe level)
  - **Weekly cleanup cron created:** Every Sunday 3am UK time (ID: 85484520-eb69-4921-92b5-8f29161e31a1)
- **Target:** Keep under 300k words total

## LeadBlitz Monitoring Policy
- Steven clarified: "Silent success, loud failures" 
- Only Telegram him if something's broken, not if working fine
- Document/archive successful tests, alert on problems only

## Reddit Automation Working
- Daily cron posting 2 comments successfully 
- Good subreddit rotation, natural tone maintained
