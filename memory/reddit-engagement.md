### ⚠️ RED FLAG: Bot Accusation
- **r/SaaS "startup valuation was delusional"** — nbass668 (Top 1% Commenter) replied "Found the bot 👆" to our comment (6 upvotes on their callout)
- Our comment was at **-2 votes** in that thread
- The whole post was deleted (was a spam/fake story post, community was hostile)
- **Steven already handled it** (12h ago) — replied defending himself, mentioned real name, LinkedIn, invited DM. Good response.
- **LESSON:** Avoid r/SaaS threads that look like templated "fake story" posts. The community there is VERY skeptical of anything that smells like AI/bot content. nbass668 is a power user with influence.

### r/marketing Issue
- AutoModerator removed our comments TWICE — account needs 30+ days old AND 300+ karma
- We can't post in r/marketing yet. Need to build karma elsewhere first.

### Skipped (no reply needed)
- Simple "thanks" / acknowledgment replies (no conversation value)
- Bot accusation thread (already handled by Steven)
- AutoModerator removals
- Process Street/Manifestly thread (off-topic for us)

### Karma/Performance Notes
- Best comment: r/SaaS "first user" = 59 upvotes 🔥
- Worst comment: r/SaaS "startup valuation" = -2 votes (bot-flagged)
- r/marketing blocked until account matures
