# LeadBlitz Outreach Email Template
## Version 2 — Updated 2026-02-15 (Steven's feedback)

### Subject Line
`We scored your website — here's the report, [Company Name]`

### Body

Hi there,

We used our AI audit tool to score [Company Name]'s website — the full report is attached.

You'll see your site scored well. [Personalise: mention 1 specific strength from their actual score if available, e.g. "Strong mobile responsiveness and fast load times."]

Now imagine sending a report like this to YOUR target customers — except theirs isn't quite so strong. You can show them exactly where they're losing visitors, where their SEO is falling short, and how you can add value. No more generic pitches — just hard data that sells your expertise for you.

That's what LeadBlitz does. It finds local businesses, scores their websites with AI, and generates personalised outreach so you can land clients with proof, not promises.

We're in early access and I'd love to offer you 500 free credits to try it — no strings attached.

Check it out: https://leadblitz.co

Happy to walk you through it if you'd prefer — just reply to this email.

Best,
Laura Vimes

### Notes
- **Key change from v1:** Don't lead with a generic compliment. Lead with the AUDIT REPORT as proof of value, then flip the pitch — show them how to use the same tool on THEIR prospects.
- **Attach:** If possible, attach or link their actual website audit report (PDF or link)
- **Personalise:** Reference their specific score/strengths
- **v1 mistake:** "Impressed by your work" = boring, they already know. Data > flattery.
