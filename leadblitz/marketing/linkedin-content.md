### About Section

LeadBlitz helps freelance web designers and solopreneurs find their next client — without cold calling, without guesswork, and without spending hours researching prospects.

Our AI-powered platform searches Google Places for businesses in any niche and location, scores their websites across 15+ technographic signals (CMS, SSL, mobile responsiveness, page speed, SEO, analytics, and more), and generates professional PDF audit reports that users can hand directly to prospects.

Contact data is a commodity. AI-generated sales ammunition is unique.

Instead of sending a generic cold email, LeadBlitz users send a professional website audit — showing the business owner exactly what's wrong with their site and what it's costing them. It's the difference between a pitch and a conversation.

**How it works:**
🔍 Search — Find businesses by niche + location via Google Places
📊 Score — AI analyses websites across 15+ quality signals
📄 Report — Generate client-ready PDF audit reports in seconds
💬 Convert — Start sales conversations with value, not cold pitches

Credit-based pricing starting at $15/month. Free credits to try.

Now building multilingual support (English + Spanish, more coming) because web designers everywhere need better leads.

## First 5 LinkedIn Posts (Weeks 1–2)

### Post 1 — Launch Teaser (Day 1, Monday)

What if you never had to cold-call for web design clients again?

I've been building something for the past few months that I'm really excited about.

It's called LeadBlitz, and it solves a problem every freelance web designer knows too well:

**Finding clients is harder than doing the actual work.**

The usual playbook — cold emails, Upwork bidding wars, "just network more" — is exhausting and inefficient.

So I built a different approach.

LeadBlitz finds businesses with weak websites, AI-scores them across 15+ quality signals, and generates professional audit reports you can hand directly to prospects.

Not a generic pitch. A professional, client-ready report showing exactly what's wrong with their website.

We're in pre-launch mode right now, building a waitlist.

First 100 signups get 500 free credits.

### Post 2 — Behind the Scenes / Problem Awareness (Day 3, Wednesday)

I spent two weeks manually researching 50 local businesses before I decided to automate it.

Here's what I was doing:
1. Search Google for businesses in a niche
2. Click through to their website
3. Check if it's mobile-friendly (resize browser)
4. Look at the source code for CMS, analytics, meta tags
5. Test page speed
6. Check SSL certificate
7. Write up notes on what was wrong
8. Draft a personalised email

For ONE prospect, this took 20-30 minutes. For fifty? Over 15 hours of mind-numbing research.

And the response rate on those emails? About 8%.

That's when I thought: what if AI could do steps 1-7 automatically, and produce something better than my manual notes?

That's what LeadBlitz does now. In seconds.

The output isn't just data — it's a professional PDF audit report the web designer can put their name on and hand directly to the prospect.

Sometimes the best product ideas come from being too lazy to keep doing something manually. 😄

### Post 3 — Product Demo Description (Day 5, Friday)

Let me walk you through what a LeadBlitz audit report actually looks like. 📄

You search for "dentists in Manchester" — the tool hits Google Places and finds 30+ dental practices with websites.

Each site gets AI-scored across 15+ signals:
✅ SSL certificate status
✅ Mobile responsiveness
✅ Page load speed
✅ CMS detection (WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, custom)
✅ Google Analytics / tracking
✅ Meta tags & SEO basics
✅ Header structure
✅ Image optimisation
✅ Accessibility flags
✅ And more

Then you click "Generate Report" and get a professional PDF:

📊 Overall score with visual grade
🔍 Detailed findings per category
💡 Plain-English recommendations ("Your site takes 8.2 seconds to load. 53% of visitors leave after 3 seconds.")
🎯 Priority actions ranked by impact

The freelancer downloads it, adds their branding, and sends it to the dentist.

The dentist gets a professional report showing exactly what's wrong with their website — not a sales pitch from a stranger.

That's the difference between "I think I can help" and "here's proof you need help."

Contact data is a commodity. Sales ammunition is unique.

### Post 4 — The Data / Proof (Day 8, Monday)

We tested LeadBlitz on 50 local businesses across 5 industries.

The results were eye-opening:

📉 72% scored below 40/100 on website quality
🔓 34% had no SSL certificate
📱 58% weren't mobile-responsive
📊 61% had zero analytics tracking
🏷️ 44% were missing basic meta descriptions
✅ Only 12% had what we'd call a "good" website

There is an enormous market hiding in plain sight.

These business owners aren't negligent — they simply don't know what's wrong with their websites. No one has ever shown them.

That's why the audit report is the key to this whole thing.

When a freelance web designer sends a business owner a professional PDF showing their site scores 28/100 with specific issues and recommendations — that's a fundamentally different conversation than "hey, I think your website needs work."

This is what LeadBlitz does. Automated sales ammunition for web designers.
