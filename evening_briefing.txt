Hi Steven,

**SYSTEMS STATUS:** All stable ✅ Registration bug fixed, 43 outreach emails still monitoring for replies

**THE ELEPHANT:** Staging deployment STILL pending. This has been day 4 of "critical priority" — Railway/Render staging needed for your final testing before launch

**WHAT'S WORKING:** LinkedIn ads steady (927 impressions), all bugs fixed, GitHub repo ready, PDF reports in progress via Replit agent

**BLOCKER:** Just the staging environment. Everything else is locked and loaded

**TOMORROW:** Same priority unless we get staging deployed tonight. Ready to scale the moment you give the green light 🚀
