# DinoRoars — App Store Optimization & Marketing Plan
**Prepared by:** Laura Vimes, Chief of Staff, SH Applications Limited
**Date:** February 7, 2026
**Status:** EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY

---

## 1. NEW SUBTITLE (30 char max)

**`Kids Dino Sounds & Fun Facts`** (29 chars)

Why: Hits "kids," "dino," "sounds," and "facts" — all high-search, low-competition keywords in the kids/education category. Replaces the generic current subtitle.

Alternative if A/B testing: `Dinosaur Sounds for Toddlers` (29 chars)

---

## 2. APP STORE KEYWORDS (100 char limit)

```
dinosaur,sounds,toddler,preschool,learning,roar,trex,jurassic,educational,animals,no ads,safe kids
```
(99 chars)

**Rules:** No spaces after commas. Don't repeat words already in app name or subtitle. Singular forms only (Apple matches plurals automatically). No competitor brand names.

---

## 3. NEW APP STORE DESCRIPTION

```
🦕 NO ADS. NO DATA COLLECTION. EVER.

Your toddler taps a dinosaur. It ROARS. Their face lights up. That's DinoRoars.

Built by a dad who wanted screen time he could actually feel good about.

WHAT YOUR CHILD GETS:
• 18 beautifully illustrated dinosaurs — from T-Rex to Triceratops
• Tap any dinosaur to hear its realistic sound
• Narrated fun facts and Q&A for every single dino
• Videos that bring each dinosaur to life
• 4 dinosaurs completely free — unlock all 18 for just $1.99

WHAT YOU GET (AS A PARENT):
• Zero ads. Not "minimal ads." ZERO.
• No data collection whatsoever — we don't even have a server to store it
• Parental gate on all purchases — your kid can't accidentally buy anything
• Educational content designed for ages 2-6
• Hand them your phone without anxiety

WHY PARENTS LOVE IT:
DinoRoars isn't a game that pretends to be educational. It's a learning tool that kids think is a game. Every dinosaur has voiced Q&A content that teaches real facts in a way preschoolers actually absorb.

Your kid will learn to say "Pachycephalosaurus" before they can tie their shoes. You're welcome.

DETAILS:
• Free download with 4 dinosaurs
• One-time $1.99 purchase unlocks all 18 (no subscriptions, no recurring charges)
• Works offline — perfect for car rides, waiting rooms, airplanes
• Made with love by SH Applications Limited

Download now. Hand your phone to your toddler. Watch the magic happen. 🦖

## 4. SCREENSHOT TEXT OVERLAYS

### Screenshot 1 — THE HOOK (most important)
**Headline:** `Tap. ROAR! 🦖 Learn.`
**Subheadline:** `No Ads. No Data Collection. Ever.`
**Background:** Show a kid-friendly T-Rex mid-roar with sound waves. NOT the home grid.

### Screenshot 2 — THE SAFETY SELL
**Headline:** `Screen Time You Can Feel Good About`
**Subheadline:** `Zero ads • Zero tracking • Parental gate on purchases`
**Background:** Show the parental gate UI or a reassuring parent-child moment with the app.

### Screenshot 3 — THE LEARNING
**Headline:** `Real Dinosaur Facts, Narrated`
**Subheadline:** `Voiced Q&A for every dinosaur — built for ages 2-6`
**Background:** Show the Q&A / learning content screen for a popular dinosaur.

### Screenshot 4 — THE COLLECTION
**Headline:** `18 Dinosaurs to Discover`
**Subheadline:** `4 free • Unlock all for just $1.99 — no subscriptions`
**Background:** Show the full dinosaur grid with colorful illustrations.

### Screenshot 5 — THE SOUNDS
**Headline:** `Hear Them ROAR 🔊`
**Subheadline:** `Realistic sounds for every dinosaur — kids can't stop tapping`
**Background:** Show a dinosaur with animated sound effect visuals.

### Screenshot 6 — THE VIDEOS
**Headline:** `Watch Dinosaurs Come Alive`
**Subheadline:** `Videos & narrated facts that turn screen time into learning`
**Background:** Show the video player screen with a dinosaur video playing.

### Screenshot Design Notes for Steven:
- Use **bright, saturated colors** — yellows, greens, oranges. Kids category = bold palette.
- Text should be **huge and readable at thumbnail size** (people scroll fast)
- Consider a consistent frame/border treatment across all 6
- Device frame optional but the trend in kids apps is frameless/full-bleed
- Tool recommendation: **Shots.so** (free), **AppMockUp**, or **Figma** with Screenshot template

## 5. FULL ASO & MARKETING PLAN

### PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE FIXES (This Week)

| # | Action | Owner | Notes |
|---|--------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Update subtitle to new version | Steven | App Store Connect → App Information |
| 2 | Replace keywords field | Steven | Exactly as written above, 99 chars |
| 3 | Rewrite description | Steven | Copy-paste Section 3 above |
| 4 | Redesign all 6 screenshots | Steven | Follow Section 4 specs exactly |
| 5 | Set primary category to **Education** | Steven | Secondary: Entertainment |
| 6 | Set age rating correctly | Steven | Ages 4+ in App Store Connect |
| 7 | Add promotional text | Steven | "🦕 No ads, no tracking — just dinosaurs!" (can change anytime without review) |
| 8 | Fix privacy policy link | Steven | Host on a proper page (GitHub Pages, Notion public page, or app website). Raw Google Docs link looks unprofessional and may cause review issues. |
| 9 | Add app preview video | Steven | 15-30 sec screen recording: kid taps dino → ROAR → shows facts. This alone can 2x conversion. Use iMovie or CapCut. |
| 10 | Localize metadata for Spanish | Steven | US has 40M+ Spanish speakers. Translate subtitle, keywords, description. Cheap win. Use a native speaker, not just Google Translate. |

### PHASE 2: SHORT-TERM (Next 2 Weeks)

#### Reviews & Ratings (Critical — Zero Reviews Is Killing You)
- **Implement SKStoreReviewController** in-app. Trigger it after a positive moment (e.g., after a child taps their 5th dinosaur or completes their 3rd Q&A). Apple allows 3 prompts per 365-day period per device.
- **Ask family & friends directly.** Steven should personally message 15-20 people: "Would you download DinoRoars and leave an honest review? It's free." Get to 5+ reviews ASAP — the difference between 0 and 5 reviews is enormous for conversion.
- **Respond to every review** that comes in, even 1-stars. Shows the app is actively maintained.

#### Facebook Strategy Restart
- **Page:** Ensure SH Applications or DinoRoars has a Facebook page with consistent branding
- **Content calendar:** 3 posts/week for 2 weeks:
  - Monday: Dinosaur fact of the week (shareable, educational)
  - Wednesday: Short video clip of the app in action (screen recording, 15 sec)
  - Friday: Parent testimonial or "did you know" post
- **Facebook Groups:** Join and actively participate (don't spam) in:
  - Parenting groups for toddlers/preschoolers
  - Homeschool groups
  - "Screen-free" / mindful parenting groups (ironically great audience — they want quality when they DO use screens)
  - Dinosaur enthusiast groups (yes, these exist and parents are in them)
- **Budget:** Even $5-10/day on Facebook Ads targeting US parents of 2-6 year olds, interest: dinosaurs/educational apps, can drive meaningful installs at this price point.

#### Quick Distribution Wins
- **Submit to Product Hunt** — "Show HN"-style launch, indie dev angle plays well
- **Post on Reddit:** r/iOSApps, r/toddlers, r/Parenting, r/dinosaurs — be transparent about being the developer
- **Web version:** Add prominent "Download the iOS App" banner to https://dinosaur-sounds-shaca147.replit.app

### PHASE 3: MEDIUM-TERM (1-3 Months)

#### Content Marketing
- **Create a simple landing page** for DinoRoars (use Carrd.co — $9/year). Include:
  - Screenshots, description, download link
  - Proper privacy policy page
  - Press kit (app icon, screenshots, one-paragraph description)
  - "As featured in..." section (fill as you get coverage)
- **Blog posts** (on Medium or the landing page):
  - "Why We Built a Kids App With Zero Ads"
  - "18 Dinosaur Facts Your Toddler Will Love"
  - "The Case for Simple Apps in a Subscription World"
  - These serve dual purpose: SEO backlinks + shareable content

#### Influencer & Media Outreach
- **Target micro-influencers** (1K-50K followers) in these niches:
  - Mom/dad bloggers who review kids apps
  - Preschool teachers on Instagram/TikTok
  - Dinosaur-themed kid accounts
- **Pitch angle:** "Solo dad builds ad-free dinosaur app for toddlers — no subscriptions, no data collection." The indie story is the hook.
- **Offer:** Free unlock code + genuine ask for honest review. Don't pay for reviews.
- **Specific targets to research:**
  - Search Instagram: #kidsapps #toddlerapps #dinosaursfortkids
  - Search TikTok: "best apps for toddlers"
  - Search YouTube: "toddler app review"
- **Send 5 outreach emails per week.** Template:

> Subject: Free dinosaur app for your little one — no ads, no catch
>
> Hi [Name], I'm Steven — I built DinoRoars, a dinosaur sounds & learning app for toddlers. Zero ads, zero data collection, $1.99 to unlock everything. I'd love for [child's name/your audience] to try it. Happy to send a free unlock code. No strings attached. Here's the App Store link: [link]

#### Cross-Promotion & Partnerships
- **Partner with other indie kids app developers** — feature each other in "Apps We Love" sections
- **Reach out to children's museums** with dinosaur exhibits — offer to be featured as a companion app
- **Libraries and preschools** — many have "app recommendation" lists. Email local ones.

#### Localization Expansion
- After Spanish, add: **French, German, Portuguese, Japanese**
- Kids apps have universal appeal — localization ROI is extremely high
- Use professional translation for at least the description and keywords

### COMPETITOR ANALYSIS APPROACH

**Direct competitors to monitor:**
1. Search "dinosaur sounds" in App Store — screenshot the top 10 results
2. Search "dinosaur kids" — screenshot the top 10
3. For each top competitor, document:
   - Price model (free/paid/subscription)
   - Rating & review count
   - Screenshot style and messaging
   - Keywords they rank for (use AppFollow free tier or AppTweak trial)

**Tools (free/cheap):**
- **AppFollow** (free tier) — track your own rankings and reviews
- **AppTweak** (free trial) — competitor keyword analysis
- **Sensor Tower** (free tier) — category rankings
- **App Store Connect analytics** — already available, check weekly

**What to steal (legally):**
- Screenshot layouts that convert well in the kids category
- Keywords competitors rank for that you're missing
- Description structures that feel compelling
- Pricing strategies that work
